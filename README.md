# mofa-nft-rendering-in-urp
This is the rendering project for the MOFA project, primarily responsible for creating and outputting the visual content of MOFA NFTs. In this project, there are visuals for three early versions of NFTs and one created during the 2023 Flow Hackathon. They are located in the scenes 'NFT Version 1' and 'NFT Version 2_Flow.'

## How does it work
For Version0.1, all nfts are composed of object "Weapon" and object "Field".

"Weapon" is the shaple in center, and "Field" is the particle field around it.

###“Weapon”

"Field" is maily influenced by the vfx asset attached:

Among all the properties, "SDF Texture" controls the shape of "Weapon".

### "Field"

"Field" is maily influenced by the vfx asset attached:

Among all the properties, "SDF" and "SDF(A)" control the shape of "Field"
